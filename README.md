To analyze HR data for workforce distribution, salary trends, performance evaluation, absenteeism, and promotion eligibility using SQL & Python.


📌 Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning, transformation, and analysis of an HR dataset containing employee details, attendance, department, and performance data. The goal is to derive meaningful insights to help HR teams make data-driven decisions.


🛠️ Tech Stack Used

✅ SQL Server – Data storage, querying & analysis
✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, PyODBC) – Data cleaning & transformation
✅ Google Colab – Data processing & visualization
✅ GitHub – Version control & project sharing



📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of four key tables:

1. employee_details – Employee demographics, salary, joining date, etc.
2. department – Department-wise details and IDs.
3. attendance – Employee attendance status (Present/Absent).
4. performance – Employee ratings and promotion eligibility.

📊 Key Analysis & Insights

1. Workforce Distribution – Identified departments with high & low employee counts for resource allocation.

2. Salary Trends – Found top earners and department-wise salary distribution to benchmark pay scales.

3. Employee Retention – Analyzed employees hired in the last two years to track hiring trends.

4. Absenteeism Patterns – Highlighted employees with frequent absences for HR intervention.

5. Promotion Eligibility – Ensured employees with Performance Rating = 5 were marked for promotion.

6. Attendance Issues – Detected employees without attendance records, signaling tracking or status issues.

7. Department-wise Salary Analysis – Revealed pay gaps and potential salary adjustments.


Final Business Impact

🔹 Optimized HR decision-making through data-driven insights
🔹 Improved employee retention & performance tracking
